# Data-Integration-2
The task involves connecting and integrating data from multiple sources, including MongoDB, Hadoop, MariaDB, Snowflake servers, SSMS and SSIS to facilitate comprehensive data analysis and processing.

These days, there are numerous reported incidents of people seeing strange objects in the sky, leading them to believe they have witnessed UFOs. Additionally, widespread rumors suggest the existence of Area 51 in Nevada, where it's said the military communicates with aliens.

I aim to integrate datasets available from various sources such as Kaggle, election studies, or data.world. These datasets will cover topics related to UFO sightings, including crime rates, mental health statistics, air quality measurements, income levels, unemployment rates, temperature data, and presidential voting records. By analyzing and correlating these datasets with the UFO dataset from Kaggle, I hope to gain insights into any relationships or patterns.

Here is the flowchart that I designed to do this project.
